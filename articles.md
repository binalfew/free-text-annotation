### Suicide Bombing Kills 15 in Mogadishu Market Attack

A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device at the busy Bakara market in Mogadishu on Friday morning, killing at least 15 civilians and injuring 23 others. The attack occurred during peak shopping hours when the market was crowded with vendors and customers.

Witnesses reported seeing a young man in his twenties approach the market entrance before detonating the device. The explosion destroyed several stalls and left debris scattered across the area. Emergency services rushed to the scene, and the injured were transported to nearby hospitals.

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released through their media channels. The group stated that the bombing was in retaliation for recent government operations against their positions in the Lower Shabelle region. Security forces have cordoned off the area and are conducting investigations.

The attack comes amid increased security operations by the Somali National Army and African Union forces against Al-Shabaab strongholds in central and southern Somalia. The group has been responsible for numerous attacks targeting civilians, government officials, and international forces in recent months.

### Ethnic Clashes Leave 12 Dead in Eastern DRC

Violent clashes between Hema and Lendu communities in the Beni territory of North Kivu province have left 12 people dead and displaced over 2,000 residents. The conflict erupted over disputed land ownership and access to water resources in the village of Kainama.

The fighting began when Lendu farmers accused Hema herders of allowing their cattle to graze on cultivated land. The dispute quickly escalated into armed confrontation, with both sides using machetes, spears, and some firearms. Local authorities reported that 8 Hema and 4 Lendu community members were killed in the violence.

The provincial government has deployed security forces to restore order, but tensions remain high. Many families have fled to neighboring villages or crossed into Uganda seeking safety. Humanitarian organizations are providing emergency assistance to the displaced population.

This latest outbreak of ethnic violence adds to the complex security situation in eastern DRC, where multiple armed groups, ethnic tensions, and resource conflicts have created a volatile environment. The region has experienced similar clashes between these communities for decades, often related to land disputes and political marginalization.

### Armed Gang Robs Bank, Kills Security Guard in Nairobi

A heavily armed gang of six men robbed a commercial bank in the Westlands area of Nairobi on Thursday morning, making off with an estimated 15 million Kenyan shillings (approximately $100,000) and killing a security guard in the process.

The robbery occurred at 9:30 AM when the gang, armed with AK-47 rifles and pistols, stormed the bank premises. They held staff and customers at gunpoint while forcing bank employees to open the vault. During the operation, they shot and killed 45-year-old security guard Peter Mwangi when he attempted to raise an alarm.

The gang escaped in two vehicles, firing shots at pursuing police officers. One police officer was injured in the exchange of gunfire. The robbers abandoned their vehicles in the Kibera area and fled on foot, making their escape through the informal settlement's narrow alleys.

Police have launched a manhunt for the suspects and are offering a reward for information leading to their arrest. The bank has temporarily closed its Westlands branch and is cooperating with law enforcement. This incident marks the third major bank robbery in Nairobi this year, raising concerns about the effectiveness of current security measures.
