## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

Use these commands to independently verify the results:

### Check Event Count:
```bash
cd "/Users/binalfew/Documents/Masters/Week 3-6/free-text-annotation"

# Count events in JSON
jq '. | length' output/stage3_extracted_events.json
# Expected: 7

# Count rows in CSV
wc -l output/test_extracted_events.csv
# Expected: 8 (1 header + 7 events)
```

### Check Article Distribution:
```bash
# Events per article
jq '[.[].article_id] | group_by(.) | map({article: .[0], count: length})' output/stage3_extracted_events.json
# Expected:
#   article_1: 1 event
#   article_2: 1 event
#   article_3: 2 events (reciprocal)
#   article_4: 1 event
#   article_5: 2 events (reciprocal)
```

### Check Reciprocal Violence:
```bash
# Count reciprocal events
jq '[.[] | select(.reciprocal_violence == true)] | length' output/stage3_extracted_events.json
# Expected: 4 (2 pairs)

# Show reciprocal pairs
jq '.[] | select(.reciprocal_violence == true) | {article: .article_id, who: .who.text, whom: .whom.text, pair: .reciprocal_pair}' output/stage3_extracted_events.json
# Expected:
#   article_3: Hema ‚Üí Lendu (pair 1)
#   article_3: Lendu ‚Üí Hema (pair 2)
#   article_5: opposition supporters ‚Üí security forces (pair 1)
#   article_5: security forces ‚Üí opposition supporters (pair 2)
```

### Check Actor Extraction:
```bash
# Verify Al-Shabaab extracted from responsibility claim
jq '.[0].who' output/stage3_extracted_events.json
# Expected: {"text": "Al-Shabaab", "type": "ORGANIZATION", "from_responsibility_claim": true}
```

### Check Casualty Extraction:
```bash
# Show events with deaths
jq '.[] | select(.whom.deaths != null) | {article: .article_id, deaths: .whom.deaths, injuries: .whom.injuries}' output/stage3_extracted_events.json
# Expected:
#   article_1: 15 deaths, 23 injuries
#   article_3: 12 deaths
#   article_5: 3 deaths
```

## üêõ Bugs Fixed (With Proof)

### 1. Actor Validation Bug
- **Before:** "Al-Shabaab" rejected
- **After:** Correctly extracted in event 1
- **Proof:** See `output/stage3_extracted_events.json` line 14

### 2. Sentence Index Bug
- **Before:** Triggers had wrong sentence positions
- **After:** All triggers have correct sentence_index
- **Proof:** All events in JSON have matching sentence_index and trigger.sentence_index

### 3. Salience Filter Bug
- **Before:** Reciprocal events filtered out
- **After:** All reciprocal pairs preserved
- **Proof:** Articles 3 and 5 each have 2 events in output

### 4. Clustering Bug
- **Before:** Reciprocal events merged into 1
- **After:** Reciprocal pairs remain separate
- **Proof:** Article 3 has 2 distinct events with different WHOs

### 5. Regex Pattern Bug
- **Before:** "between X and Y" didn't match
- **After:** Correctly parses reciprocal patterns
- **Proof:** Articles 3 and 5 extract both actors

### 6. Ethnic Group Support
- **Before:** "Hema" and "Lendu" not recognized
- **After:** Both extracted as actors
- **Proof:** Article 3 events show "Hema" and "Lendu" as actors

### 7. Duplicate Reciprocal Events
- **Before:** Multiple triggers created duplicates
- **After:** One reciprocal pair per sentence
- **Proof:** Article 5 has exactly 2 events (not 3)

### 8. Missing Article IDs
- **Before:** Events didn't track source article
- **After:** All events have article_id
- **Proof:** CSV column 1 shows article_id for all rows
