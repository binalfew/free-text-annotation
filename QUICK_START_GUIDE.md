# Quick Start Guide - Violent Event Annotation System

## 🚀 5-Minute Overview

### What Does This System Do?

**INPUT:** News articles about violence in Africa
**OUTPUT:** Structured event data (who did what to whom, where, when, how)

### Example

**Input Article:**
```
"A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device at Mogadishu market on Friday,
killing 15 civilians. Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility."
```

**Output:**
```
Actor: Al-Shabaab
Event Type: Suicide Bombing
Victim: civilians
Deaths: 15
Location: Mogadishu
Date: 2024-03-08 (normalized from "Friday")
Taxonomy: Political Violence > Terrorism > Suicide Bombing
```

- **File:** `output/extracted_events.csv`
- **Format:** CSV with 27 columns (actor, victim, location, date, taxonomy, etc.)

---

## 📋 Output Columns

| Column | Example | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **article_id** | article_1 | Unique article identifier |
| **who_actor** | Al-Shabaab | Perpetrator of violence |
| **who_type** | TERRORIST | Actor category |
| **whom_victim** | civilians | Target/victim |
| **deaths** | 15 | Number killed |
| **injuries** | 23 | Number injured |

| **completeness** | 1.00 | How complete (0-1) |

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Actor Extraction** (50% accuracy)
Identifies perpetrators using:
- ✅ Responsibility claims: "X claimed responsibility"
- ✅ Title patterns: "Police officers fired..."
- ✅ Grammar analysis: Subject of violence verb
- ✅ Validation: Rejects markets, adjectives, etc.

### 2. **Taxonomy Classification** (NEW!)
3-level hierarchy:
```
Political Violence
  ├─ Terrorism
  │   ├─ Suicide Bombing
  │   ├─ Car Bombing
  │   └─ Armed Assault
  ├─ Election Violence
  └─ Insurgency

State Violence Against Civilians
  ├─ Extrajudicial Killings
  │   └─ Police Shooting
  └─ State Repression of Protests

Communal Violence
  └─ Ethnic/Tribal Conflict

Criminal Violence
  └─ Armed Robbery/Banditry
      └─ Bank Robbery
```

### 3. **Date Normalization** (NEW!)
Converts relative dates:
- "Friday" → "2024-03-08"
- "Tuesday" → "2024-03-12"
- "yesterday" → "2024-03-14"

### 4. **Quality Metrics** (FIXED!)
- **Confidence:** How reliable is extraction? (0-1)
- **Completeness:** How many 5W1H filled? (0-1)

---

## 📈 Performance

| Metric | Before | After | Status |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Correct actors | 0% | **50%** | ✅ Major improvement |
| Correct taxonomy | N/A | **33%** | ✅ New capability |
| Normalized dates | 0% | **33%** | ✅ Working |
| Valid completeness | 0% | **100%** | ✅ Fixed |
| Critical errors | 3 | **0** | ✅ Eliminated |

---

## 💡 Use Cases

## 🔍 Example Walk-Through

### Input Article:
```markdown
## Article 1: Political Violence - Terrorism
**Date:** March 15, 2024
**Location:** Mogadishu, Somalia

### Suicide Bombing Kills 15 in Mogadishu Market Attack

A suicide bomber detonated an explosive device at the busy Bakara
market in Mogadishu on Friday morning, killing at least 15 civilians
and injuring 23 others.

Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement
released through their media channels.
```

### Processing Steps:

**Step 1: Parse Metadata**
```
Title: "Suicide Bombing Kills 15..."
Date: "March 15, 2024"
Location: "Mogadishu, Somalia"
```

**Step 2: NLP Analysis**
```
Sentence 1: "A suicide bomber detonated..."
  Tokens: [A, suicide, bomber, detonated, explosive, device, ...]
  Entities: [Mogadishu (LOCATION), Friday (DATE)]
  Trigger: "detonated" (violence verb)

Sentence 2: "Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility..."
  Entities: [Al-Shabaab (ORGANIZATION/TERRORIST)]
```

**Step 3: Extract Event**
```
Trigger: "detonated"
WHO: "Al-Shabaab" (from responsibility claim ✓)
WHAT: "bombing"
WHOM: "civilians" (deaths: 15, injuries: 23 ✓)
WHERE: "Mogadishu" ✓
WHEN: "Friday" → normalized to "2024-03-08" ✓
HOW: weapons: ["explosive", "suicide bomb"], tactics: ["suicide"] ✓
```

**Step 4: Classify Taxonomy**
```
Actor type: TERRORIST → Level 1: Political Violence
Has suicide tactic → Level 2: Terrorism
Suicide + explosive → Level 3: Suicide Bombing ✓
```

**Step 5: Calculate Quality**
```
Confidence: Has all 6 components → 0.95 ✓
Completeness: 6/6 components → 1.00 ✓
```

### Output Row:
```csv
article_1,article_1_event_1,"Suicide Bombing...",Al-Shabaab,TERRORIST,civilians,15,23,Mogadishu,2024-03-08,"explosive, suicide bomb",suicide,Political Violence,Terrorism,Suicide Bombing,0.95,1.00
```

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

### What Works Well (50-100%):
- ✅ Actor extraction for responsibility claims
- ✅ Actor extraction for title patterns
- ✅ Casualty extraction from clear patterns
- ✅ Date normalization for relative dates
- ✅ Taxonomy for terrorism and state violence

### What Needs Work (0-33%):
- ⚠️ Actor extraction for ethnic/gang violence
- ⚠️ Multiple event detection (reciprocal violence)
- ⚠️ Casualty extraction from complex sentences
- ⚠️ Taxonomy for communal/criminal violence

---

## 🚦 Quality Indicators

### High Quality Events (Use Immediately):
```
Confidence >= 0.8 AND Completeness >= 0.8
→ Minimal human review needed
```

### Medium Quality Events (Quick Review):
```
Confidence >= 0.5 AND Completeness >= 0.5
→ Check actor and casualties
```

### Low Quality Events (Full Review):
```
Confidence < 0.5 OR Completeness < 0.5
→ Treat as suggestions, verify all fields
```

## 🎓 Next Steps

1. **Try it:** Run on the 5 sample articles
2. **Review results:** Check `output/extracted_events.csv`
3. **Compare:** Look at `final_results_summary.md` for detailed analysis
4. **Customize:** Modify patterns in `event_extraction.py` for your use case
5. **Extend:** Add new taxonomy categories in `taxonomy_classifier.py`

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Error: "Module not found"
```bash
pip3 install dateparser python-dateutil pandas numpy
```

### Error: "File not found"
Check that `articles.md` exists in the project directory

### No events extracted
- Check if articles have violence keywords
- Verify article format matches expected structure
- Review logs for extraction issues

---

## ✨ Success Metrics

**System is working correctly if you see:**
- ✅ Events with actor names (not "The" or "Violent")
- ✅ Dates in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- ✅ Completeness scores between 0.5-1.0
- ✅ Taxonomy with 3 levels
- ✅ No critical errors in output

**Example of GOOD output:**
```
Actor: Al-Shabaab ✓
Taxonomy: Political Violence > Terrorism > Suicide Bombing ✓
Date: 2024-03-08 ✓
Completeness: 1.00 ✓
```

**Example of BAD output (should NOT see):**
```
Actor: Bakara ❌ (This is a market!)
Actor: The ❌ (This is an article!)
Date: Friday ❌ (Not normalized)
Completeness: 0.00 ❌ (Bug)
```
