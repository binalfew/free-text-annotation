## Critical Bugs Fixed

During pipeline execution, the following bugs were identified and fixed:

### 1. Actor Validation Bug
**Problem:** "Al-Shabaab" rejected because substring "a" matched non-actor list
**Fix:** Check actor keywords FIRST before non-actor validation
**Proof:** Event 1 correctly extracts "Al-Shabaab" from responsibility claim

### 2. Sentence Index Bug
**Problem:** Triggers had token index instead of sentence index
**Fix:** Set correct sentence_index when building events
**Proof:** All events have correct sentence positions for salience scoring

### 3. Salience Filter Issue
**Problem:** Reciprocal violence events filtered out
**Fix:** Exempt reciprocal events from salience threshold
**Proof:** Articles 3 and 5 correctly output 2 events each

### 4. Clustering Bug
**Problem:** Reciprocal events merged together
**Fix:** Prevent reciprocal events from clustering
**Proof:** Hema→Lendu and Lendu→Hema remain separate

### 5. Regex Pattern Bug
**Problem:** `[^and]` means "not chars a,n,d" not "not word 'and'"
**Fix:** Use `(.+?)` with proper terminators
**Proof:** "clashes between Hema and Lendu" correctly parsed

### 6. Ethnic Group Support
**Problem:** "Hema" and "Lendu" not recognized as actors
**Fix:** Added African ethnic groups to actor keywords
**Proof:** Article 3 correctly identifies both groups

### 7. Duplicate Reciprocal Events
**Problem:** Multiple triggers created duplicate reciprocal pairs
**Fix:** Process only one reciprocal pair per sentence
**Proof:** Article 5 outputs 2 events (not 3)

### 8. Missing Article IDs
**Problem:** Events didn't preserve article context
**Fix:** Add article_id to each event
**Proof:** CSV shows correct article_id for all 7 events
